So, I have made a programming language that I call luaBase. I know, the name is so unoriginal, but I suck at naming things. It is a simple python-like language that you can compile using the luaBasec.exe file
then finally run using luaBase.exe. I hope you like this language and if you find errors please let me know! Thank you!
