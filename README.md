So, I have made a programming language that I call luaBase. I know, the name is so unoriginal, but I suck at naming things. It is a simple python-like and lua-like language that you can compile using the luabc.exe file
then finally run using luab.exe. I hope you like this language and if you find errors please let me know! Thank you!

Also, I do not have a proper installer for this, so if you want, you can put the two exe's in a folder and add that to your PATH so it can be accessed from anywhere. This way, you will be able to just type luabc <file> <output> and then luab <file> from any folder without having to type out the full path of the exe's.
