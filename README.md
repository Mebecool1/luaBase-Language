So, I have made a programming language that I call luaBase. I know, the name is so unoriginal, but I suck at naming things. It is a simple python-like and lua-like language that you can compile using the luabc.exe file
then finally run using luab.exe. I hope you like this language and if you find errors please let me know! Thank you!

Also, you can find the package manager, foundation, for luaBase at: https://github.com/Mebecool1/foundation-packages
There, you can find all the packages you need or you can also install the foundation.exe in releases, which is the main package manager and installs or updates packages depending on if you have the package or not.
Rest of the information for foundation will be there at the given link.
